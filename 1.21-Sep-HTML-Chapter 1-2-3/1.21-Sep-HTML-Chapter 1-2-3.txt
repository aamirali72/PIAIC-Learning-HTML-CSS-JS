Headings and paragraphs, Bold, italic, emphasis, Structural and semantic markup

In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to the text that appears on your pages. You will learn about:
. Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
. Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on

XX Numbered lists
XX Bullet lists
XX Definition lists

There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
?? Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

<ol>
The ordered list is created with the <ol> element.

<li>
Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The listands for list item.)

?? Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
<ul>
The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.

<li>
Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The listands for list item.)

?? Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

<dl>
The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and <dd> elements.

<dt> This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
<dd> This is used to contain the definition. Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different  efinitions for the same term.
