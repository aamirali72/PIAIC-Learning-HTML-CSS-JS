How to add images to pages
Choosing the right format
Optimizing images for the web

There are several things to consider when selecting and preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them right will make it look more attractive and professional.
In this chapter you will learn how to: Include an image in your web pages using HTML
?? Pick which image format to use
?? Show an image at the right size
?? Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages load faster
You can also use CSS to include images in your pages using the background-image property, which you will meet on pages

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

You will commonly come across the following types of links:

Links from one website to another
<a href="https://www.youtube.com"> Click here to watch my video </a>
Links from one page to another on the same website
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"> Click here to google </a>
Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page
Links that open in a new browser window
Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

Links from one website to another

The text between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag is known as link text. Where possible, your link text should explain where visitors will be
taken if they click on it (rather than just saying "click here"). Below you can see the link to IMDB that was created on the previous page.
